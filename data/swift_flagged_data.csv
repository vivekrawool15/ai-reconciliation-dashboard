Dear Client,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you in regard to your recent transaction with us, ID: TRX12144, where you attempted to transfer an amount of 89647.7 EUR with the purpose labeled as ""send to me.""

Unfortunately, the transaction has been flagged due to a 'Payment Purpose Mismatch.' This usually occurs when the information provided in the 'Purpose of Payment' field does not correspond appropriately with the nature of the transaction or is not sufficiently detailed for our system to process.

This will help us to ensure that all transactions align with regulatory guidelines and assist in the seamless processing of your transactions.

We understand that this might be an inconvenience for you and we apologize for any confusion caused. To rectify this issue, we kindly ask you to provide a more detailed description of the purpose of this transaction. You can do this by logging into your account and updating the transaction details, or if you prefer, you can reply to this email with the relevant information and we will update it for you.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team. We are here to help!
